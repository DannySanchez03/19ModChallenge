## Description

In this Module 19 Challenge we were told to clone a github repository and implement the functionalitys of the todo's comments inside of the client folder files. This app is a text editor that can work offline, it can also be installed from your browser.

## Installation

I was having trouble deploying this application on render, this is what ended up showing up on the console.
After checking if the port being 3000 I switched it on the server.js file, I ended up trying 4000 becuase I had looked at the documentation and that didnt solve the problem. It would be nice if I can get some feedback towards why my app isn't being deployed.
